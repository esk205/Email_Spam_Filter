# Email_Spam_Filter
# This email spam filter project uses the NLTK library and the Kaggle Dataset (for spam and non-spam emails) to
# determine if an email is spam or not.
#
# The NLTK library already uses Bayes Theorem since Bayes Theorem is a popular way to do machine learning, so
# for the sake simplicity it is best to not reinvent the wheel and use that implementation.
